# NeuroEvolutionary-SnailJumper
Implementation of a Neuro Evolutionary algorithm to optimize a simple neural net to achieve the best result in SnailJumper game in Spring 2022 at CE@AUT

# Implementation Detail
## Neural Network
### Input
- Coordinates of k-closest obstacles(snails and bees)
- Euclidean Distance from player to the closest obstacle
### Activation Functions
- Sigmoid
- ReLU
- tanh
## Selection Algorithms
- Top k Players (based on fitness)
- Roulette Wheel (RW)
- Stochastic Universal Sampling (SUS)
- Tournament Selection (Q-Tournament)
